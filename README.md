# Employee-Tracker


Breakdown: 
When a user starts the application, they are presented with a landing page that displays the following options: view all department, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add a employee, and update an employee role. When a user chooses any of the view all options, they are presented with the current data in that table. When a user chooses any of the add functions, the user is asked to type the required data to create that entry. When a user chooses the update employee role, the user is given the option to choose from existing employees and existing roles. When the user selects the existing employee and role, the role is updated in the database and displayed in the view all employee option.
